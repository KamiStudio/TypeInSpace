Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is the second largest planet after Jupiter. Saturn was named after the Roman god Saturnus. Like Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, it is a "gas giant". Saturn is best known for its rings which were first seen by Galileo Galilei in 1610 with his telescope. These rings which are only 10 m thick and 120,700 km wide, are made of ice, rocks and dust.
